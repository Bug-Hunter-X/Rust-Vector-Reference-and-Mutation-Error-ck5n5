This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming related to vector references and mutations. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides the corrected version. This example highlights the importance of understanding Rust's ownership and borrowing system to avoid unexpected runtime panics.  The error arises because the push operation invalidates the reference to `vec[0]` created earlier.  The solution demonstrates how to avoid this using cloning, or other techniques to ensure that references remain valid.
